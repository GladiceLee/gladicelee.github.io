    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    Welcome, and thanks for stopping by. This site is a place where I share my work in business analytics, shaped by hands on experience in operations, supply chain, and data analysis. I am currently a graduate student in Business Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, and my interest in analytics comes from working closely with real business challenges, from managing inventory to understanding how everyday decisions affect cost, efficiency, and customer outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here, you will find projects that reflect how I think and work. The examples range from demand forecasting and process optimization to dashboard development and automated reporting, all grounded in practical business contexts. I enjoy taking messy data and turning it into clear, actionable insights using tools such as Python, R, SQL, and business intelligence platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
    Along the way, I have earned professional certifications in data analytics and continue to learn through both coursework and independent exploration. I value clarity, curiosity, and thoughtful communication, and I hope this space gives you a genuine sense of how I approach problems and grow as an analyst. Below, you will find selected projects and certifications that reflect this work in practice.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
    I am drawn to problems where data helps bring clarity to everyday decisions, especially in operations and supply chain settings. I enjoy digging into questions around forecasting, process improvement, and why things do not always work as expected, then using data to make sense of it. What I find most rewarding is turning complex or messy information into insights that are practical and easy to communicate, whether through analysis, visuals, or simple explanations.
